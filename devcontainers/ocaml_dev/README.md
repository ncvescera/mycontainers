# Ocaml + Jupyter DevContainer

This is the ocaml dev environment with a Jupyter server 🚀.

The ocaml kernel doesn't work inside VSCode notebooks (damn camel 🐫) but only in the web jupyter notebook.
When you need to use Jupyter Notebook just run `jupyter notebook` on a terminal in the dev container !!
